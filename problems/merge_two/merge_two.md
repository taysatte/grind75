### Example 1:

Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4]
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

Constraints:<br>

```The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50]```<br><br>
```-100 <= node.val <= 100```<br><br>
```Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order```<br><br>

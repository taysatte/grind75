So, this repo is basically designed to serve as a log of my journey (struggle) throughout the infamous ```Grind 75``` <i>LeetCode</i> problems that will hopefully improve my overall understanding of programming and problem solving(tbd). The aim/goal of this project is to <b>completely</b> understand each problem to its <b>core fundamental level</b>. In doing so, I will be writing out a <i>detailed explanation of each solution</i> and addressing each problem-solving technique and applicable data structure used. I will try to make a record of my thoughts throughout each week of problems to document my personal experience.

I doubt this will reach any type of public light, but if you have somehow stubbled upon this, let me know if there are any blunders throughout the problems that I have missed! <3

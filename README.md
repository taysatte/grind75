This repo is basically designed to serve as a log of my journey (struggle) throughout the infamous <b>Grind 75</b> <i>LeetCode</i> problems that will hopefully improve my overall understanding of programming (tbd). The aim/goal of this project is to fully understand each problem to its core <b>fundamental level</b>. In doing so, I will be writing out a <i>detailed explanation of each solution</i> and addressing each problem-solving technique used. I will try to make a record of my thoughts throughout each week of problems to document my personal experience. I doubt this will reach any type of public light, but if you have somehow stubbled upon this, let me know if there are any blunders throughout the problems that I have missed! <3
